"TRAIN OF THOUGHT" BY SANDY GUNTUPALLI

The term project, "Train of Thought," is an attention-training game challenging players to direct an accelerating stream of trains to their corresponding stations. The objective is to enhance focus and minimize distractions by anticipating and switching tracks in advance, ensuring all trains follow the correct path. The game will include features like power-ups to temporarily slow down trains and an autopilot feature, where the path is automatically adjusted for a brief duration.
